<h1>About {{ config('app.name') }}</h1>
<p>Hey! I'm Micha≈Ç, and I've created a few blogs to help people visiting the South of France, including this one, {{ config('app.name') }}.</p>
<p>I'm a former student of the university in Monaco and now reside in Villefranche sur Mer.</p>
<p>The South of France itself is incredible, offering rich scenery, culture, and gastronomy, but the technology-mindset is still lacking. Because of this, a lot of breathtaking areas remain unexplored by visitors. This blog aims to fix that.</p>
